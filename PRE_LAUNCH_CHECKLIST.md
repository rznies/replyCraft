    - [ ] Verify core AI reply generation logic is working as expected across various inputs (message content, tones, contexts).
    - [ ] Test accuracy and appropriateness of AI suggestions for different languages (English, Hinglish).
    - [ ] Ensure AI consistently provides 3-5 reply suggestions as intended.
    - [ ] Confirm that AI suggestions are generally under 20 words.
    - [ ] Test edge cases for AI input (e.g., very short messages, messages with only emojis, long messages).
    - [ ] Evaluate the "vibe" and "Gen-Z" quality of replies â€“ do they sound authentic for college students?
    - [ ] Test special interaction dynamics (e.g., 'ex' + 'ghostedMe') for appropriate tonal output.
- [ ] **Contextual Parameter Handling:**
    - [ ] Test all input parameters (language, tone, timing, senderType, relationshipVibe, mood, goal, additionalContext) and ensure they influence AI output correctly.
    - [ ] Verify default behaviors when optional parameters are not provided.
- [ ] **API Endpoint:**
    - [ ] Confirm the `/api/suggest-reply` endpoint is reachable and functioning correctly.
    - [ ] Test successful (200) responses with valid inputs.
    - [ ] Test error responses (400, 401, 429, 500) with invalid or problematic inputs.
- [ ] **Stability & Error Handling:**
    - [ ] Ensure graceful error handling for AI service failures or timeouts.
    - [ ] Verify that unexpected inputs to the API do not crash the server.
    - [ ] Check server logs for any unusual errors or warnings during testing.

## 3. Security & Data Privacy

- [ ] **Authentication & Authorization:**
    - [ ] **API Key Review (`src/app/api/suggest-reply/route.ts`):**
        - [ ] Evaluate if the current API key authentication (`API_ROUTE_SECRET`) is suitable for the primary user base (college students).
        - [ ] **Consider User Accounts:** Discuss implementing user accounts (e.g., OAuth with Google/student email, or simple email/password) as potentially more user-friendly and secure for individual users than distributing a shared API key.
        - [ ] If user accounts are added, define the purpose of the existing API key auth (e.g., for third-party integrations) or plan for its deprecation for end-user access.
    - [ ] Ensure robust password policies and secure storage if direct user accounts are implemented.
- [ ] **Rate Limiting (`src/app/api/suggest-reply/route.ts`):**
    - [ ] Verify current IP-based rate limiting (10 requests/minute) is functioning.
    - [ ] **Per-User Limits:** If user accounts are implemented, consider adding or shifting to per-user-account rate limits, which might be more equitable and effective.
    - [ ] Evaluate if the current rate limits are appropriate to prevent abuse without hindering normal user activity.
- [ ] **Input Validation:**
    - [ ] Confirm Zod validation (`GenerateSmartReplyInputAPISchema` in `src/app/api/suggest-reply/route.ts`) is active and effectively prevents malformed requests.
    - [ ] Ensure all user-supplied data is validated before processing.
- [ ] **Prompt Injection Defense (`src/ai/flows/generate-smart-reply.ts`):**
    - [ ] Verify prompt injection defenses are in place and effective (e.g., instructing the LLM to treat user input as data).
    - [ ] Conduct tests with potential prompt injection payloads.
- [ ] **Data Privacy & Logging (`src/ai/flows/generate-smart-reply.ts` & API):**
    - [ ] **Application Logging:** Define what data (e.g., messages, user inputs, IP addresses) is logged by the ReplyCraft application. Minimize logging of PII.
    - [ ] **AI Provider Logging:** Understand and document what data is logged or retained by the AI provider (e.g., Google Genkit). Review their data usage policies.
